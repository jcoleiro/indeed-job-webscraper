Today, 60 million Americans are working independently - in gig work or otherwise - and that trend is only accelerating. For many Americans, benefits are tightly coupled with their full-time, W2-based jobs where they receive group-based benefits. For the 60M Americans working independently and outside of that safety net, they need to find medical coverage on their own. That's where Stride comes in. We make it incredibly easy and intuitive to find the best and most affordable health care coverage for independent workers and their families, including dental, vision, life, accident, and disability coverage. All the same benefits you'd expect from a W2 employer, but built specifically for independent workers.\n\nStride partners with the world's leading platforms and employers of non-benefited workers including DoorDash, Uber, Postmates, MasterCard, Amazon, Aon, Keller Williams and others to help them provide their workers access to affordable health and wealth benefits and perks.
