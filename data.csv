Today, 60 million Americans are working independently - in gig work or otherwise - and that trend is only accelerating. For many Americans, benefits are tightly coupled with their full-time, W2-based jobs where they receive group-based benefits. For the 60M Americans working independently and outside of that safety net, they need to find medical coverage on their own. That's where Stride comes in. We make it incredibly easy and intuitive to find the best and most affordable health care coverage for independent workers and their families, including dental, vision, life, accident, and disability coverage. All the same benefits you'd expect from a W2 employer, but built specifically for independent workers.

Stride partners with the world's leading platforms and employers of non-benefited workers including DoorDash, Uber, Postmates, MasterCard, Amazon, Aon, Keller Williams and others to help them provide their workers access to affordable health and wealth benefits and perks. The company is backed by Venrock, New Enterprise Associates, and F-Prime Capital Partners.

As our benefits enrollment platform gains more traction and continues to grow, so too does the complexity of our accounting operations, customer and vendor contracts, and financial instrumentation. For that reason, we're seeking a Controller to develop the team, implement and mature our accounting processes, and be a critical strategic thought partner to the business as we continue to scale. We are looking for a builder who can uplevel our accounting operations, systems, and tooling, and be a critical anchor in helping Stride grow our business.

We are a growing yet still small team (50+ employees) and believe in how small teams work - iterating and learning quickly. We believe you do your best work when you're working with a team you enjoy, leveraging your skills and experience to drive value, and focusing on new challenges that require new learning every day. Since we're small, we can guarantee you'll be doing a little bit of everything here. You love to bring creativity to your work to find top talent, love teaching others and helping your team succeed, and find satisfaction in building a company one quality hire at a time.

We're looking for somebody who is:
Passionate about their craft - we value people who love what they do, and take pride in their work. We want to see that passion in you for understanding the financial mechanics of the business, and delivering value through sound accounting practices and decisions.
Able to see the forest for the trees - You have an ability to understand downstream impacts of accounting decisions, how to leverage accounting to drive financial performance and KPIs, and a keen ability to go from the 2 to the 20,000 ft view.
Comfortable with ambiguity - You have a demonstrated ability to operate in a world of unknowns, where you are the expert and exercise appropriate executive judgement, make sound decisions exclusively, and advocate for those decisions effectively.
A builder - comfortable hiring and scaling teams, implementing new systems and tools, instrumenting our financials to yield deeper insights, and partnering with our engineering and product teams to drive deeper integrations between our accounting and product infrastructure.
